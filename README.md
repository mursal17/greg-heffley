Hello I am Mursal

üß†I have some Brain and Super Powersüê±‚Äçüèç

Do you know, I know coding?

Do you know what is coding?

Wait I will tell you

Coding is used for making apps and websites

For normal people it is very complicated so you have to learn patiently

I am good at that but not that good because I am bad in JavaScript(JS)

HTML is used for creating components you see in websites and add functions that do nothing

CSS is used to design those components

JS is used for making those functions work that you have added in HTML

Now you know a little bit about coding and here is something you should know

Do you know that there are apps and websites that use block coding that is very easy here is a link of one of the block coding websites <https://thunkable.com/> it is used to make apps

Always remember these things and you can use this website to make websites <https://codepen.io/>

BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
